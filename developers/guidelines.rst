Post questions to the busterjs-dev mailing list
===============================================

The `busterjs-dev mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/busterjs-dev>`_
is a place for general discussion regarding development of Buster.JS. In many
cases you can just post an issue to `the issue tracker
<https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues>`_  and the discussion can happen
there. But you can also discuss on the mailing list if you're more comfortable
with that. For example, you might prefer to use email for discussion, or you
want to discuss your contribution before posting it to the issue tracker.


Coding style
============

We don't have one yet :)

For now, look at some existing code to get an idea of what our code looks like.


Understanding Buster.JS
